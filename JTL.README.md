UCI- DATA ANALYTICS - Project 1 / Group 2
This part of the project seeks to examine if there is a change in genres preference between 2000 to 2019.

To examine this question, data was obtained from www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019 into a CSV file for further analysis. This data pulls from the Spotify API and contains the top 2000 streamed songs from 2000 to 2019. 

A stacked bar chart was created to visualize the changes in genres preference over time. The top two genres, "pop" and "hip pop" remains the top two genres during this time frame. 

To quantify the data, two pie charts were created to show the most popular genres in 2008 and 2019. Both "pop" and "hip pop" made up the top two genres -- with approximately 85% and 91% of the top song streamed in 2008 and 2019 (respectively) from these two genres. Interestingly,

In conclusion, there does not appear to be a change in genres preference between 2000 to 2019.
