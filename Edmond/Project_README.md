UCI- DATA ANALYTICS - Project 1 / Group 2
Worked w/ Jenny Le, Landon Stubblefield, and Joseph Karadakis.
Using Spotify API, PyTrend module, and datasets acquired from Kaggle, we were able to analyze Top 200
songs from 2017 to 2021 and use Spotify's song parameters to see what qualities help songs rise in the charts.

All visualizations were created by our team.
