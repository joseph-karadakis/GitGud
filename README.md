We are exploring trends in music through time. 
Specifically we are establishing Spotify as the go to streaming service. 
Grabbing track audio features using the Spotify API and then exploring trends in said audio features. 
After that we do an analysis of preference of music genre over time and if it is affected by large socioeconomic events.
